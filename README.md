# OrpheusMS #

## What is OrpheusMS? ##
OrpheusMS is a MapleStory private server, and repack developed by Aaron Weiss, based on the MoopleDev source. It's a project started solely for the sake of wasting my own time. It's made for MapleStory v.83, and aims to be as professional as possible.

## Why OrpheusMS? ##
As a developer, I love to spend time programming, but my ideas are often limited for a large variety of reasons. This was a project that I thought was perfectly reasonable to do, and I got caught up in the idea after reminiscing about my experiences with private servers many years ago.

## What's in a name? ##
OrpheusMS is a name that attempts to pay homage to one of the original powerhouses of the MapleStory private server scene, OdinMS, by utilizing a different mythological being in its name. From Odin, a powerful god of War, to Orpheus, a humble musician and poet, shows respect.

## Can I use OrpheusMS? ##
This question should be kind of obvious, as you're pretty much staring at the source code for it right now, but *absolutely*! I love the idea of someone else taking advantage of the work I put in, and that's why I've made this project open source. Feel free to use it as you will!

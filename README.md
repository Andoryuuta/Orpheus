## What is OrpheusMS? ##
OrpheusMS is a MapleStory private server, and repack developed by Aaron Weiss, based on the MoopleDev source. It's a project started solely for the sake of wasting my own time. It's made for MapleStory v.83, and aims to be as professional as possible.

## Why OrpheusMS? ##
As a developer, I love to spend time programming, but my ideas are often limited for a large variety of reasons. This was a project that I thought was perfectly reasonable to do, and I got caught up in the idea after reminiscing about my experiences with private servers many years ago.

## What about features? What makes OrpheusMS great? ##
If I had to pick just one thing, I'd say that it's the ease of customizability. My goal, as I added feature upon feature, was to make sure that users could pick and choose exactly how they'd like their server to be set up, in a manner that was simple, clear, and effective. This stands above other server sources that make no effort to aid future users in quickly, and clearly enabling or disabling features at a whim. The configuration files are transparent, and give as much information as needed to understand what each feature does, and I believe that truly is something that makes Orpheus unique, and an obvious best choice for v.83 servers.

## What's in a name? ##
OrpheusMS is a name that attempts to pay homage to one of the original powerhouses of the MapleStory private server scene, OdinMS, by utilizing a different mythological being in its name. The transition from Odin, a powerful god of War, to Orpheus, a humble musician and poet, is intended to show respect to its origins.

## What MoopleDev revision is OrpheusMS based off of? ##
The project began based off of revision 116, but as it is continuing to be updated, I will merge whatever changes I see fit onto my source. So, you shouldn't really expect it to always be close to the head revision of MoopleDev.

## Can I use OrpheusMS? ##
This question should be kind of obvious, as you're pretty much staring at the source code for it right now, but *absolutely*! I love the idea of someone else taking advantage of the work I put in, and that's why I've made this project open source. Feel free to use it as you will!
